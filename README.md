# PingTool
PingTool helps detect bottlenecks in networks

PingTool is a Linux based networking tool that uses IP addresses as input and then runs the ping command on each IP address in succession.
This can be helpful when dianosing a conplex network where multiple hops are needed. By providing PingTool with all the IP addresses a packet
requires to reach its desitnation, greater visibility of network bottlenecks can be had.

PingTool uses only built-in Python libraries so no depenancy installation is required.

Currently PingTool is available on Unix/Linux based machines, however there are plans to release it on Windows as well.

If you find any efficiencies that can be made please let me know or make your own copy!
